# Lecture 1 - History of Perception

### Readings 

- Frisby & Stone "Seeing", The Computational Approach to Biological Vision
- Wade, 1998 "Light and sight since antiquity"

### Empedocles (492 - 432 BC) Emanation Theory

- Greeks wrote their ideas down first so they are the only members of history we know that tracked how to see
- Our eyes are sending out beams of light that are interacting with the universe, the universe is emanating beams of light back that give way to vision

### Galen (2nd Century AD)
- our eye sends out rays of light to an object and that object returned rays of light to the eye. There is a replica of the outside object in our retina that is then sent down the optic nerve. 

### Summary of Greek Ideas
- eyes emitted rays of light
- objects were active agents in perception
- Replicas, or images of the outside world are carried to the brain. GGalen understood that the brain was the seat of all mental images and sensations

### Alhazen (965 - 1040)
- Islamic science was far ahead of European science
- He was the first person to work out that the reason we can see objects is because objects reflect light to our eyes which enable us to see the object. Objects do not send out light, they reflect light from a light source (the sun for example)
- Alhazen invented the pin-hole camera (also called the camera obscura). He thought the eye worked like a pinhole camera. In order to get enough light in the eye (as opposed to the weak image of a pinhole), you need to a larger hole to let enough light in. But if you just increase the size of the hole, the image becomes more blurry. The lens allows us to produce sharper images while also letting in larger amounts of light. 
- He rejected Emanation theory
- He understood that images were formed in the eyes because of optics
- Perceived colour du to colour of object and colour of light that the object reflects to our eyes. There are 2 things needed to perceive colour!

### Descartes (1596 - 1650)
- Understood the importance of the lens for creating a focused image
- Because we have 2 eyes, we have 2 images of the eye that must be combined. this combination takes place in the brain. 
- Noted that even if you could produce an image in your head does not constitute perception. It is important to analyze the image in order to see all the different features of the image
- He also thought that god understood what was in the image and translated that into perception where the penial gland was mediated the space between the soul / god and the physical world. 

### The Homunculus Fallacy 
- that there is a little person in your head looking at another person in your head

### Summary of Renaissance Ideas
- Recognized the problem of a "sensorium" or "homunculus"
- believed that the optic nerve carries images
- Recognized that 2 images had to be fused binocularly to produce a single view of the world

# Isaac Newton (1642 - 1727)
- Understood that white light is made up of a combination of many different colors of light. Beams of light are separated into its wavelengths! Although we know now that this is not a physical property of light, but rather how the brain processes different wavelengths. We process what is continuous, into distinct bands of color. 
- He noted that color itself is not a property of light, our brain allows for the sensation of color but is not a physical property of light. The world we see is in part created inside our head. 

### Summary of Post Renaissance Ideas
- Spectrum of colours is continuous
- the colour of an object is the result of the ability of that object to reflect various colours in the spectrum 
- light waves are not themselves coloured, but elicit a coloured sensation. 
- Belief that the results of colour mixing were due to the physical properties of light rather than a visual process.  
- lens of the eye produced the retinal image 
- the homunculus in the head was able to see the contents of the image
- the world we perceive is not a simple copy of physical reality

### Helmhaltz (1821 - 1894)
- different dimensions of sound / vision, we would have different groups of neurons that were sensitive to parts of that dimension. 
- Developed the channel theory. there are different channels for different colours, depths, frequencies, etc.
- Believed that visual illusions were cause by "unconscious inference". For example, simultaneous color contrast and simultaneous brightness contract: 2 identical things can look different depending on the context that object is in even if those objects have the same luminance. 
- Objects can appear convex or concave depending on the way they are shaded because of our assumptions of light sources. 

### By the end of the 19th century...
- different sensations (pain, tough, smell, sight, hearing) are mediated by different physiological structures in the nervous system 
- the origin of sensory qualities lay in the structure of the nervous system and not the nature of the outside world
- within a modality (e.g. sight) different nerve fibers respond selectively to different stimuli (e.g. different ranges of wavelength). This is what gives way to the modern theory of channels!
- perception is affected by in-built knowledge of the world, i.e. is not a simple transformation of the raw sensory input
