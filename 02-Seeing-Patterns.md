# Lecture 2 - Seeing Patterns 1

### Readings 
- Basic vision, CH. 4

### Scale
- Each object is made up of different objects as you get a closer look 

### Effects of Bandpass Filtering 
- Allows us to look at the different scales of an image
- Unfiltered: just the image itself
- Lowpass filtered: remove fine detail but leave course detail (most information of brightness information)
- Highpass filtered: remove course detail and leave fine detail (most information of the object is here)

### Fourier Components of a Square
- sin wave gratings to measure our sensitivity to different scales
- you can decompose an image into a sum of a series of sin waves.
- square wave: shows luminance profile. this is the sum of a series of sin waves at different frequencies.

### Sin Wave Gratings 
- Cycle: single up and down of the pattern 
- Lmax = max luminance 
- Lmin = lowest luminance 
- Lmean = average luminance
- Contrast = (Lmax - Lmin)/(Lmax + Lmin)

### Contrast of a Sin Wave
- The only difference between high medium and low contrast is the amplitude of the sin wave cycle
- high contrast has a value of 1, low has a value of 0.01

### Visual Angle
- this tells us the size of an image on our retina.
- An object can be the same size at different distances, but the object that is further away will have a smaller visual angle. 

### Spatial Frequency of a Sin Wave
- number of cycles of modulation per unit of visual angle (cpd)
- low SF is when the bars are far apart (1 cpd). High SF is when the bars are close together (4 cpd).

### Contrast Threshold
- the minimum amount of contrast you need to just see the bars in the stimulus 

### Two - alternative forced choice task (2AFC)
- lots of trails of pairs of patterns. one has the bars and the other does not. You need to press a button to indicate the image that has the bars in it. 
- from this you produce a psychometric function plots the proportion of correct responses against an increasing contrast threshold. (sigmoidal in shape for reasons he doesn't explain)
- the size of the data points indicates the amount of trials that occurred at a particular contrast.
- The contrast threshold (getting the correct response 75% of the time) is around a contrast of 0.016.

### Contrast sensitivity function (CSF)
- Contrast sensitivity = 1 / contrast threshold 
- Contrast sensitivity vs Spatial frequency with logarithmic tick marks makes a nice sloping parabola shape. There is a drop off in sensitivity at high spatial frequency (cant see the bars anymore at this point)

### Snellen Eye Chart 
- The viewing distance of 6 meters / 20 feet can just read the letters at the 8th level. This person has 20 / 20 vision. (the standard for visual acuity)
- People who are less good can only do smaller levels. (lower visual aquity levels) This person has 20/30 vision. So a good person at 20 feet can actually read this level from 30 feet. 

### Word Bank
- Visual angle: degrees (deg), minutes (arcmin), seconds (arcsec)
- Luminance: L, candelas per square metre (cd/m2)
- Mean Luminance:  Lmean (cd/m2)
- Sine-wave grating: L(x)=Lmean+Asin(2fx+p) (A=amplitude, f=spatial frequency,p=phase)
- Michelson Contrast:  C (Lmax-Lmin)/(Lmax+Lmin) or A/Lmean
- Cycle width, or period: Degrees of visual angle (deg)
- Spatial Frequency (1/cycle width): Cycles per degree (c/deg or cpd)
- Contrast threshold: Minimum detectable contrast C
- Contrast sensitivity: 1/Contrast threshold i.e. 1/C
- Acuity or resolution limit: Highest spatial frequency at which a grating can be detected when at full contrast (c/deg)
- Reflectance: % of light reflected
- Brightness: Perceived luminance
- Lightness: Perceived reflectance

### Experiment with SF
- Channels are selective for SF, if you adapt to a certain channel, you desentitize to that pattern. if you look at a test pattern that has the same SF as the pattern you adapted to because your back channel has been desensitized. However if you were looking at a spatial frequency that is different then the test image, you will be able to see it (you can still see the bars). 
- Channels aren't just selective to SF, but orientation as well

### Experiment with Orientation
- If you habituate to a specific orientation over time, you will not be able to see the same orientation in an after image. If the after image is of a different orientation you will be able to see it :)

### Effects of Adaption on Contrast Sensitivity
- When we adapt to a particular SF, our contrast sensitivity does down for that particular frequency. - The difference between the adapted curve and the original contrast vs SF curve tell us how much the channel has adapted to that particular frequency. With this information, we can generate tuning curves (CSF) that highlight the difference between these 2 curves. This channel is adapting to a particular spatial frequency. 
- if we do this for many different SF, we will get a series of tuning curves for different groups of neurons selective to particular SF (this is psychophysics)

### Example: Physiological recordings of contrast sensitivity in simple cells of a cat
- each neuron group has a particular to a particular SF (bell shaped curve)
- in summary: can see this physiological vs external testing to see these curves!


### Changes in contrast sensitivity
- Sensitivity changes in Development, mean luminance, age, eccentricity
- Development: Children are less sensitive compared to adults because their neurons have not developed yet. (but develops quickly after just a few months from birth)
- Mean luminance: Scotopic (dark) has lower SF compared to Photopic (light)
- Age: high spatial frequency we lose over time
- Eccentricity: resolution suffers with SF

### What do babies see? 
- When the baby is young, the face is really blurred. after 3 months they can see more detail. as an adult they see the adult clearly.
- the textbook is right because babies cannot see fine detail 
- the textbook is wrong because the babies do not necessarily see the face as blurred. they would actually see a few blobs of sharp parts of the face. (they cannot see the detail fully)
