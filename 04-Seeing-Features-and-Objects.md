# Seeing Features and Objects 

### Edges in cave paintings, cartoons, children's art
- edges are important for recognition 
- first artworks are just edge drawings that reflect this importance (as well as these other examples)
- you can convey an object from just its outline

### Edges in processed images
- take 2 tone images (black and white). Use this to make a high-passed filtered image. edges on either side of the border have the same luminance but because of the lines shading, it appears different in luminance. 
- if we reverse the polarity of the edge, the image no longer looks as easily recognizable. 
- this is known as the Cornsweet illusion 

### Receptive field 
- the region of the visual space within which a stimulus will alter the firing rate of a neuron. 

### Receptive field in the Retinal Ganglion cells
- There are on center - off surround receptive fields as well as off center  - on surround receptive fields

### Receptive field in the Cortex - Simple cells
- elongated receptive fields that are orientationally selective. Many neurons combine to create this receptive field

### Receptive field - Response Profiles
- Circularly symmetric (in the retina and early stages of the cortex - an on or off center with an on or off surround)
- Odd Symmetric Oriented (on one side its excitatory and the other side is inhibitory)
- Even Symmetric oriented (even center and 2 inhibitory sides)

### Convolution of a even symmetric oriented receptive field
- zero crossing = the edge of a line 
- biphasic 
- the wider the field (tuned to lower SF) will create a wider biphasic response profile plot. in other words, the line that goes through the zero crossing will be less steep. 

### David Marr - Zero Crossings in filter output
- you can recognize an image by just a pattern of zero-crossings 
- the issue with the problem of zero crossings = you must work out where the crossings are (which requires lots of computations .... this is non trivial)

### Zero crossings at different scales
- if you use 3 different sizes of a circular symmetric filter to find crossings from an image, the larger sizes have less detail. 
- given that zero crossings are noisy, he came up with the spatial coincidence rule

### Spatial Coincidence Rule
1. if zero-crossings are spatially co-incident in the responses of 2 or more channels of different scales in the image, then this indicates the presence of a feature
2. if zero-crossings in course-scale channels are spatially coincident with zero crossings at finer-scale channels, then the features that you see are those represented in the finer scale channels. (as long as you have 2 channels which produce 0 crossings that are coincident then you are happy to choose the finer one to tell you that there is a feature there! We can see fine detail in images!)

... there is not a lot of evidence for this though!

### Blocked Image 
- Course quantification 
- takes a particular region and averages the luminance in that region to plot it over the whole of the square

### Blocked Image and Zero Crossing
- taking the zero crossings of a blocked image results in a smooth representation of the image with a wide scale.
- You gradually go from course to fine as you increase in scale. THe small scale zero crossings pick up all the details in the blocked image that are not important

### "Prior knowledge" and its impact on perception 
- examples of prior knowledge = Gestalt laws

### Gestalt laws of organization 
- Good continuation 
- Pragnanz or "good figure"
- Similarity 
- Proximity 
- Symmetry 
- Common fate
- Meaningfulness or familiarity 

### Good continuation 
- Example: even though an object is partially obscured, we know that it continues from outside our view (behind the obscurity)

### Contour detection experiment 
- Straightish path vs Curvy path
- Objects that are randomly on a plane can look continuous even though they are scattered
- Straightish paths are easier to detect then curvy paths 

### Model of good continuation 
- When you have 2 neurons that are co-aligned they excite eachother (stronger response) then with either of them on their own. 
- The law of continuation  = the whole is greater then the sum of its paths 

### Good continuation in Glass Patterns 
- start off with a random array of dots. 
- produce another image of a random array of dots but shifted. in this image you see circular structures. 

### Pragnanz / "good figure"

### Proximity & Similarity 
- Objects that are close to eachother appear to produce lines 
- Objects that are similar in color appear to produce lines 

### Proximity + Similarity 
- things look extra lined 

### Proximity vs Similarity - which is dominant 
- For me, similarity wins out, but for others its Proximity

### Symmetry 
- Features pop out that are symmetric (ex: human faces)

### Common fate
- A surface of objects that move together are perceived to be together 

### Meaningfulness of familiarity 
- based on minimal features, we can make assumptions of the overall object. (example of prior knowledge / top down processing)
- Spotty dog figure = an array of dogs can appear to be a spotty dog (another similar example)

### Prior knowledge?
- Q. which of the above Gestalt laws are examples of the influence of prior knowledge on perception? (for us to decide)

### Prior knowledge ... Hourglass vs Vase (Ambiguous figures)
- example of top down processing (what a glass looks like and faces look like... this imposes one of 2 interpretations on the image that do not happen at the same time.)
- ambiguous figures were used a lot by Salvador Dali 

### Prior knowledge ... Penrose staircase 
- local representation appears to be going up
- global representation is confused. 
- these are impossible figures

### Prior knowledge ... 'Light comes from above' assumption 
- based on our knowledge about light sources, it causes things to appear concave vs convex (this effect is lost when moved horizontally)

### Prior knowledge ... Shiny versus Matte 
- different forms of movement can make an image appear matte or shiny (Don kersten)
- Things are perceived different ways dependent upon what things look like on a shiny surface vs a matte surface. (2 things are combined: light & material)


### Prior knowledge ... Ball in box
- A ball is moving along the same path but the shadow is moving differently. 
- Our perception of where the ball is depends on where the shadow is located despite the ball being along the same trajectory 

### Images that are shown before will effect images that come after 

### Fake images surrounded by their real image will appear to be the same thing as the real thing (and thus harder to distinguish as fake)

### Kanizsa Triangle 

### Muller Lyre Illusion 
- Gregory's explanation: These are the inside and outside corners of a building. Inward fins are if you are standing from outside looking at a building. Outward going fins means that we are inside the building at its corner. related to size constancy 
- another explanation: averaging the lines. there is less information in the outward fanning lines. 

### Judd illusion 
- images look displaced from eachother 

### Illusions of perceived sizes 
- same sized images on the retina, those that appear to be far away will be presumed to be larger. 

### Leaning tower illusion 
- read the paper on the illusion 

### Zollner illusion 
- orientation contrast 

### Are these examples of Prior knowledge? 
1. The motion after effect 
2. the light comes from above assumption
3. perceived colors of the rainbow
4. Orientation selective neurons in the cortex
5. illusory contours as in the Kaniza triangle
6. perception of mirror-symmetry
7. insensitivity of cortical neurons to uniform illumination
8. common fate
