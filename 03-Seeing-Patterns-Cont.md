# Lecture 3 - Seeing patterns 3

### Tilt Aftereffect
- straight line patterns look tilted when you adapt to looking at tilted lines for a prolonged period of time 
- the direction of the shift in tilt is the direction away from the adaptor. 
- this shows that we have orientation selective neurons. 

# Neural Explanation of the Tilt Aftereffect
- subsequent dissimilar orientations appear repulsed away and produces a shift in the peak response away from the adapted orientation. 
- Each neuron responds best to one orientation and its response drops off as its orientation shifts away to create an orientation tuning curve which is bell shaped (sensitive to 1 orientation but also side to side)
- we do not see as many orientations as we have orientation selective neurons. Instead, if we look at a group of neurons selective to particular orientations, they as a group are able to make discriminations based on each orientation step. AKA it is the peak of activity of the group
- once neurons adapt to a particular orientation (say on the right), their peak activity decreases. When we look at a new orientation away from the adaptor (vertical line to the left) the pattern of neural activity is shifted slightly too far past the vertical line to the left since the adapted neurons on the right are desensitized to orientations.
- we are not looking at neurons that are maximally sensitive, it is a distribution!

# Simultaneous Tilt Contrast
- tilt induction

# Principle of Univariance 
- Responses of a single neuron of 2 stimuli with different strengths and orientations is a simple bell curve. the neuron is being stimulated by its preferred orientation and contrast / thickness of the orientation (a lower thickness might elicit a lower max signal of activity for that particular neuron)
-  BUT we cannot just look at a particular neuron and see its pattern of activation to distinguish orientation because of this principal. Neurons are unable to unambiguously signal the orientation of the stimulus which is why we always look at a pattern of activation of a group.  
- the preferred orientation of a group of neurons. the peak average response to each stimulus signals the stimulus orientation unambiguously in both cases. (looking at the average pattern of activity)
- this principal was revealed in the tilt aftereffect 

# Measuring Spatial-Frequency Bandwidth in Octaves
- To measure the bandwidth of Spatial Frequency (SF) of stimulus in cpd for a given neuron we must look at the SF in octaves vs the response of the neuron
- 1 octave = 1 doubling of SF at half the response height
- What is the bandwidth, how many doublings of SF at half response height? from 4 to 32 there is 3 doublings

# Measuring Spatial-Frequency in Degrees
- Orientation bandwidth given in degrees at half response height ? from 15 to 30 there is 15 degrees 

# Why is Bandwidth Important?
- Some neurons have narrow bandwidths and others have broad bandwidths. 
- many neurons with NARROW bandwidths that span all the orientations allow the neurons to: accurately discriminate orientations BUT you will need a lot of neurons to process an image (which is beyond the storage space of our brains) == a lot of energy consumption 
- many neurons with BROAD bandwidths that span all the orientations allow the neurons to: not discriminate orientation reliably BUT uses energy more efficiently 
- the brain compromises between these 2 extremes. 

# Motion Aftereffect: 
- if you stare at a waterfall long enough with downward movement, when you look away you will see upward movement of the waterfall 
- staring at inward movement long enough and then you diver your eyes, will cause the final image to look like its expanding. 
- AKA habituating to motion in 1 direction will cause you to see motion in the opposite direction when you look away. 

# Spatial Frequency Aftereffect
- change in perceived frequency 

# Curvature Aftereffect
- habituating to curvature in 1 direction, causes the inverse curve when changing images. 

# Shape-Frequency Aftereffect
- Fixate in the middle spot for about a minute with one line with a high shape frequency and another with a low shape frequency. The video will then stop showing the 2 stationary contours with the same shape frequency. The stationary contours will be perceived to have the inverse shape-frequency from the ones we have been fixating on. (high appears low and low appears high)
- REMEMBER: aftereffects are REPULSIVE 

# Color Aftereffects 
- habituating to 1 color and going to a blank after image will make you see the inverse color. 

# The Lilac Chase
- A pattern of violet dots is displayed in a circle. when a violet dot is switched off, it results in a green shade. 

# McCollough Effect
- Habituate to violet horizontal lines and green vertical lines. when you look at a black and white image with black and white lines in different orientations, you will see violet in vertical stripes and green in the horizontal stripes
- this demonstrates color selectivity paired with orientation 

# Face Aftereffects 
- a morph of 2 faces is made. if you adapt to a particular face, you will see the other face when looking at the morphed image.
